## GitHub Game-off 2012 Submission

**AreaOfEffect** games presents **Forky's Revenge**, our submission for the GitHub Game-off.

The cutlery of FoodLand are tired of their enslavement. You play a brave fork, chosen to lead the revolution against the evil food minions.
Rise up and destroy all the food so they can be free! The food will not go quietly...

Use the arrow keys or WSAD to move and SPACE to shoot.

The candy of FoodLand-equally mistreated by the 'normal' food citizens due to their 'questionable' nutrition-have decided to
ally with Forky in his journey. Look for the peppermint power-ups for special abilities!
